Information about Assignment 3 (Part 2) for Fall 2023

There are several source files:

serial.c     Serial version
matmul.c     Auxiliary function required for serial version 

There are separate Makefiles for the serial and MPI codes.

There are two sbatch scripts: build-run-serial.sh for the serial code; build-run-mpi.sh for the MPI codes.
The time limit is set to 30 minutes, which ought to be enough time.

There is one sample output file.
